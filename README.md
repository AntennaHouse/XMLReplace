# XMLReplace

This is a utility to scramble an XML document by replacing the characters within
text nodes with a random character of the same class (upper, lower, numeral).

Text within XML attributes is not modified.  Entities are also not modified.  Only ASCII characters are replaced.

 * --mask option will replace all text node characters (except entities) with 'T'.  This option will also work for non-ascii characters.
